GLAMURS
=======


:Full title: Green Lifestyles Alternative Models and Up-scaling Regional Sustainability
:Duration: January 2014 to December 2016
:Website: http://glamurs.eu
:Grant Nr: 613420
:Role: WP leader

The overall aim of GLAMURS (Green Lifestyles, Alternative Models and Upscaling Regional
Sustainability) has been to develop a theoretically-based and empirically-grounded understanding
of the main obstacles and prospects for transitions to sustainable lifestyles and a green economy in
Europe as well as of the most effective means to support and speed up these transitions in Europe.
GLAMURS explored the complex interactions and links among economic, social, cultural, political
and technological factors influencing sustainable lifestyles and transformations to a green economy
across societal levels (from individual to social, and from micro- to macro-economic levels), it
developed and evaluated comprehensive models of lifestyle change at a European level in key
sustainability domains, and provided assessments of these models in terms of economic and
environmental effects, in order to provide recommendations to decision-makers for achieving a
sufficiently-fast paced transition in Europe in line with the objectives established in the Europe 2020
strategy and the Resource Efficiency Flagship Initiative.

CREEA
======

:Full title: Compiling and Refining Environmental and Economic Accounts   
:Duration: April 2011 to March 2014
:Website: http://www.creea.eu/about
:Grant Nr: 265134
:Role: Working on updating EXIOBASE in Work Package 7, focusing on the Rest of the World regions.

       
The main goal of CREEA was to refine and elaborate economic and environmental accounting principles as discussed in the London Group and consolidated in the future SEEA 2012, to test them in practical data gathering, to troubleshoot and refine approaches, and show added value of having such harmonized data available via case studies.

Within this project, we compiled version 2 of EXIOBASE_.
