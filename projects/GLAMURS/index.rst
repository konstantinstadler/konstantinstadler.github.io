The overall aim of GLAMURS (Green Lifestyles, Alternative Models and Upscaling Regional Sustainability) has been to develop a theoretically-based and empirically-grounded understanding of the main obstacles and prospects for transitions to sustainable lifestyles and a green economy in Europe as well as of the most effective means to support and speed up these transitions in Europe.  GLAMURS explored the complex interactions and links among economic, social, cultural, political and technological factors influencing sustainable lifestyles and transformations to a green economy across societal levels (from individual to social, and from micro- to macro-economic levels), it developed and evaluated comprehensive models of lifestyle change at a European level in key sustainability domains, and provided assessments of these models in terms of economic and environmental effects, in order to provide recommendations to decision-makers for achieving a sufficiently-fast paced transition in Europe in line with the objectives established in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Resource Efficiency Flagship Initiative.
