The Environmental Footprints web-page collects data from multiple international databases and enables users to extract environmental information of countries and regions.

To facilitate the data comparability, environmental accounts are provided in a standardised classification. In addition, the Environmental Footprints web-page includes various visualisations to illustrate the environmental impacts of countries with an in detail break down of EU regions.

The results presented here only show output from considerable amount of work put into the original databases - so please cite and use the original data for your analysis. The results also utilise standardised classifications developed by others.
