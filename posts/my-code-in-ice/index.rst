My Code Is Now Preserved in the Arctic for 1,000 Years

I recently discovered something pretty remarkable: two of the open-source projects I started, 
`country_converter`_ and `pymrio`_, have been archived in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault. 
This means that snapshots of my code are now stored on archival film, sealed in a vault 250 meters 
deep within a mountain in Svalbard, Norway, designed to last for at least 1,000 years.

The GitHub Arctic Code Vault aims to preserves open-source software for future generations. It's amusing to think that when future civilizations are potentially rebuilding society after some unforeseen catastrophe, they'll have access to these crucial tools. I can only imagine that amidst rediscovering fire and agriculture, one of their top priorities will surely be to standardize country names (thanks to `country_converter`_) and conduct multi-regional input-output analyses (courtesy of `pymrio`_).

I'm clearly doing my part to help sort out their future-world economic modeling needs.

Jokes aside, my sincere thanks to GitHub for this initiative. It's projects like these that remind us why open-source development matters and why sharing our work with the world can have impacts far beyond what we initially envision.
